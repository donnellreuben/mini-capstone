1. In your mini-capstone, add a new model called Supplier. It should have the attributes: name, email, and phone_number (all are strings).
2. Use the rails console or seeds file to add 2 or 3 suppliers to your database.
3. Then, add a migration to add supplier_id (which must be an integer) to your products table.
4. Use the rails console or Postico to associate products with suppliers by updating the empty supplier_id data.
5. Bonus: Create routes and a controller for your Supplier model, so a user can CRUD a supplier.
